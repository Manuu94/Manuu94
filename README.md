- 👋 Hi, I’m @Manuu94, currently studying Business Informatics.
- 👀 I have a passion for computer science..
- 🌱 I already have an advanced knowledge in C and Java, basic knowledge in Javascript and Python.
    Of course I can handle also HTML, CSS and Wordpress.
    Currently I'm also learning database systems and therefore I'm a motivated beginner in it.
    The wordpress thing was a joke of course :) that was just my hobby in school.
- 💞️ I would be very happy if there is someone here who has the same interests and would like to build up a contact, 
     to exchange ideas and if necessary to help each other.
